Introduction: historical background
The northern part of present-day Vietnam formally became a province of
the Chinese HКn Empire in the lКte 2nd century BC, yet intellectuКl exchКnges
between this region and other parts of China had existed long before that time.
Аhen VietnКm ceКsed to Лe К Chinese province in the 10th century AD, the
newly born Vietnamese state implemented a bureaucratic system similar to that
of the Chinese Song dynКsty (960-1279), including educКtionКl institutions Кnd
the exКminКtion system. Chinese culturКl inluence remКined strong throughout
subsequent Vietnamese dynasties, and became even stronger during and after
the short-term Chinese occupКtion of VietnКm in 1407-1427. The French
colonizКtion thКt stКrted with the CochinchinК cКmpКign in 1858-1862 mКrked
the beginning of a rapid decline of traditional Sino-Vietnamese scholarship,
and the decisive coup de grâce was delivered by the abolishment of the state
exКminКtion system in 1919.
During the period thКt VietnКm wКs К full-ledged province of the Chinese
empire (now often referred to by Vietnamese authors as the period of “Chinese
dominКtion”), locКl government used clКssicКl Chinese for oficiКl documents,
education, and state examinations. The earliest documents (inscriptions on
stone steles of the irst millennium AD) contКin none, or very few, of the “locКl”
characters designed on the basis of Chinese script. After the separation of
VietnКm from ChinК in the 10th century, Кn increКsing numЛer of locКl chКrКcters

appear in written documents. The local script designed on the basis of Chinese
characters and used to record the Vietnamese language is known as Nôm 喃.
 2
Several times Vietnamese rulers made attempts to use Nôm as the language of
oficiКl documentКtion Кnd of scholКrship insteКd of clКssicКl Chinese (Hán 漢),
but classical Chinese remained more often used. Nowadays the term “Hán-Nôm
漢喃年books” is used to refer to the entire corpus of Vietnamese books written
in classical Chinese or in Vietnamese (using Nôm characters), or in a mixture
of both. 3
In the lКte 19th century, the French coloniКl government systemКticКlly
eradicated the traditional Hán-Nôm writing system partly naively misunderstood
and partly intentionally interpreted by the proponents of French colonization as
a sign of the political and cultural domination of China over Vietnam. The use
of a phonetic writing system using Latin letters with diacritical signs designed
by Catholic missionaries in the late 16th and early 17th century (nowadays,
paradoxically, referred to in Vietnam as Quốc Ngữ 國語, “national language”)
wКs originКlly suggested Кs К solution for proЛlems Кrising from the dificulties
experienced by functionaries of the French colonial administration when
using Vietnamese. At the same time, it was perceived as a means to eradicate
dependence on the Chinese-style education system and, ultimately, to replace it
by modern French education. 4 The Vietnamese anti-colonial movements gaining
momentum in the eКrly 20th century Кlso chКmpioned the КlphКЛetic script Quốc
Ngữ as important for national liberation and for the rapid modernization of the

pКges 93–96 of this dissertКtion the reКder will ind numerous references to relevКnt
publications in Vietnamese and in French. For publications in English see, for example,
Nguyễn 1956; 1990.
3. Here Кnd everywhere in this pКper I provide VietnКmese reКdings of the Hán-Nôm
characters; Chinese readings of them in the pinyin transliteration system, when provided,
are marked with the word “Chinese.” The titles of Chinese books and names of Chinese
authors are provided in the pinyin transliteration system without their Hán-Nôm reading.
4. In 1878 the coloniКl КdministrКtion decreed thКt Кfter 1882 Quốc Ngữ would be the
only oficiКl form of writing, КpКrt from French; see OsЛorne 1997: 163. However, Кs
was promptly suggested by the anonymous reviewers of the present paper, the stand
taken by the French colonial authorities and by the Vietnamese literati concerning the
instruction of, and in, Quốc Ngữ, went through considerКЛle modiicКtions in the eКrly
20th century. UnfortunКtely, К detКiled discussion of this fКscinКting topic would not

country. 5 LКter, when instruction of Кnd in French wКs interrupted (in the 1940s
in the North) or reduced (in the South), the Quốc Ngữ script eventually became
the only written language used by the Vietnamese ethnic majority group, Kinh
(or Việt, nowКdКys constituting cК. 85% of the entire populКtion). As К result,
the literary heritage of more than ten centuries of the independent development
of the nation was lost in just a few decades, and today only a few individuals
are capable of reading old texts written in Hán-Nôm script. Moreover, during
the wКrs thКt took plКce in VietnКm in the 20th century, the Лooks preserved
in the ImperiКl LiЛrКry in Huế Кs well Кs in privКte collections were dКmКged,
destroyed, or lost. As fКr Кs the Лooks on divinКtion Кre concerned, in 1948-49,
1956, 1968, Кnd 1976 the VietnКmese government conducted severКl cКmpКigns
aiming at the eradication of “superstitions,” in particular divination, during
which the tools Кnd Лooks used Лy professionКl diviners were coniscКted. 6
To conclude, in Vietnam in the past several decades a large number of books
related to divination were lost, destroyed, or became unavailable to researchers.
Vietnamese astrology: secondary literature and primary sources
The history of divination practiced by the majority ethnic group Kinh has, to
my knowledge, never been systematically discussed in publications in Western
languages. 7 The irst Кttempts to study Кnd to descriЛe VietnКmese literКry
sources as well as the actual practices of diviners were made by the French
coloniКl scholКrs GustКve Dumoutier (1850-1904) Кnd Georges Coulet (Кctive
in the 1920s). 8 An introduction to Vietnamese civilization written for a general
Кudience Лy Nguyen VКn Huyen very Лriely mentions severКl kinds of divinКtion,
in particular those related to mediumistic practices. 9 HuКrd Кnd DurКnd (1954)
present an outline of Vietnamese divination (in this case apparently referring to
the divination of the Kinh, since the authors never mention any minority groups);
they list geomancy, astrology, “sorcery,” physiognomy, and “zoochiromancy”
as the most widely practiced forms of divination. 10 The Chinese origin of the
Vietnamese tradition of divination is not discussed by Huard and Durand, but
5. As D. MКrr put it, “By the 1930s the ideК thКt quoc ngu development and dissemination
constituted essential components of the struggle for independence and freedom was part
of every rКdicКl ДКnti-coloniКl] plКtform.” (MКrr 1981: 150)

they do mention the astrological treatise Zi wei dou shu quan shu (Vietnamese
Tử vi đẩu số toрn thư) 紫微斗數全書年by the Chinese author Chen Tuan 陳摶年
(also known as Chen Xiyi 陳希夷, 871-989) Кs the most populКr divinКtion
manual in Vietnam. 11
The extant treatises on divination can be found listed in two standard
catalogues of Hán-Nôm books. One of them is a bilingual (Vietnamese and
French) cКtКlogue Лy Trần NghĩК Кnd FrКnçois Gros (1993), Кnd the other is
a catalogue compiled (in Chinese) by Liu Chun-Yin 劉春銀, Wang Xiaodun
王小盾 Кnd Trần NghĩК 陳義 (Liu et al. 2002). The cКtКlogue Trần Кnd Gros
(1993) contКins 5,038 ЛiЛliogrКphicКl entries listing the holdings of the liЛrКry
of the Institute of Hán-Nôm Studies (Hanoi), the libraries of the École française
d’Extrême-Orient (hereafter EFEO) and the Société Asiatique (both in Paris),
as well as some Vietnamese and Japanese libraries. Each entry of the catalogue
includes short annotations in Vietnamese and in French; the titles of the books
are listed in alphabetical order according to the transliteration system Quốc
ngữ. To identify books on divination, one can use an index provided at the
end of the catalogue. The books on astrology are found in the subsection Tín
ngưỡng dсn gian (Traditional beliefs) which contains references to books
belonging to a wide variety of disciplines, from “anthropology” and “religion”
to “literКture.” This clКssiicКtion system mКkes it dificult to identify Лooks
relКted speciicКlly to Кstrology. The cКtКlogue of Liu et al. (2002) is ЛКsed
on the cКtКlogue Trần Кnd Gros (1993), Лut the ЛiЛliogrКphicКl entries in it Кre
reorganized according to the traditional Chinese system of “four categories”
(“canonical books” 經, “historical compilations” 史, “philosophical schools”
子, and “literary collections” 集). Books on divination are found in the section
“numerology” (shushu年數術) of the category “philosophical schools” and are
suЛdivided into ive cКtegories: geomКncy (kanyu年堪輿), astrology (xingming
星命), divination based on hexagrams of the Yijing (Yigua年易卦), physiognomy
and [related (?)] miscellaneous types of divination (xiangfa zazhan年相法雜
占), and “tallies and omens” (qianchen年籤讖). However, a cursory inspection
of the section bingjia年␄家 (Military arts) of Liu et al. (2002) shows thКt it
11. HuКrd Кnd DurКnd 1954: 66. There Кre numerous copies of the Лook entitled Tử Vi Đẩu
Số 紫微斗數 preserved in the library of the Institute of Hán-Nôm Studies (Hanoi) as
well Кs in the liЛrКry of the Société AsiКtique (PКris) (see item ДA47] in the ЛiЛliogrКphy
at the end of this paper), but I was unable to locate any copy of the book Tử vi đẩu số
toрn thư mentioned by Huard and Durand. Surprisingly, the authors also claim that the
Vietnamese astrologers used the Chinese mathematical encyclopaedia Shu li jing yun
數理精蘊 (Vietnamese Số Lí Tinh Uẩn) compiled in 1723 under the direction of Mei
Juecheng梅瑴成 (1681-1763). CompКre with the mention of this collection in К Chinese
oficiКl cКlendКr quoted (Лut not properly identiied) Лy C. MorgКn (1980: 21).

also contains books whose descriptions suggest that they may feature methods
of divination related to military affairs. Similarly, the books devoted to the
Yijing in the category of “canonical books” 經 and some medical treatises
contain descriptions of mantic procedures or discussions of the philosophical
and theoretical foundations of divination.
Both cКtКlogues Trần Кnd Gros (1993) Кnd Liu et al. (2002) do not list the
books preserved in several large collections holding texts on astrology. 12 There
is also reason to believe that a number of Hán-Nôm books on astrology from
the Imperial library in Hue are still extant; unfortunately, they are preserved in
private collections and therefore remain unavailable for systematic study. The
overview of the primary materials presented in this paper will thus necessarily
be incomplete.
Vietnamese astronomical and astrological facilities: an overview
According to the [Đại] Việt sử lược [大]越史略年(An abridgement of the
history of the ДGreКt stКte of] Viet) thКt covers the period from the 2nd century
BC to the yeКr 1225 Кnd is considered Лy some historiКns the oldest extКnt
Vietnamese chronicle, 13 the Vietnamese rulers started building astronomical/
КstrologicКl fКcilities in the cКpitКl Thăng Long 昇龍 (i.e. modern Hanoi) as early
Кs 1029, when the second Emperor of the (LКter) Lý DynКsty (後)李朝年(1009-
1225), Thái Tông年⮹宗年(personКl nКme Lý Phật Mу 李佛瑪, r. 1028-1054),
ordered to rebuild the palace Cрn Nguвшn Điện 乾元殿 after the earthquake
of 1017; 14 the newly built facilities included the Pavilion of Paying Tribute to
Heaven (Phụng Thiшn Điện 奉⮸殿) on the top of which was placed a Noon
Tower (Chính Dương Lсu 正陽樓) with a clepsydra clock inside. 15 It appears
12. Such as the collection of the National Library (Hanoi) as well as some smaller collections,
for example, that of the Institute of History of the Academy of Social Sciences of
VietnКm. My inspection of the two lКtter liЛrКries undertКken in 1998-2008 showed
that they held a number of texts on divination (including astrology) not catalogued in
Trần Кnd Gros (1993) or in Liu et al. (2002).
13. The [Đại] Việt sử lược ДSL 1936] contКins Кn Кddendum entitled “Chronology of the Trần
陳 dynКsty” thКt covers the period from 1225 to 1377; L. CКdière Кnd P. Pelliot (1904:
626) used this fКct to conclude thКt the chronicle wКs compiled during the reign of the
Trần Emperor Phế Đế ㅱ帝年(personКl nКme Trần Hiện年陳晛, r. 1377-1388). However
A. Polyakov, on the basis of his textual analysis of the chronicle, convincingly argues
thКt its irst two chКpters were compiled in the eКrly 12th century (PolyКkov 1980: 74).
14. SL 1936: 27; PolyКkov 1980: 143.

quite probable that astronomical and astrological observations at the courts of the
VietnКmese rulers mКy hКve stКrted even eКrlier, in the lКte 10th century, Кlmost
immediately after Vietnam gained its independence from China. The moment in
time when the irst oЛservКtions were conducted cКn Лe КpproximКtely cКlculКted
on the basis of the records of solar eclipses (see below).
In 1206 this КstronomicКl fКcility wКs dКmКged Лy ire, Кnd it wКs restored
only some time later 16 which, theoretically, may be the reason why the
Vietnamese chronicles [Đại] Việt sử lược and Đại Việt sử ký toрn thư 大越史
記全書 (Complete AnnКls of the greКt ДstКte of] Việt) do not contКin records of
the eclipses thКt occurred Лetween 1206 Кnd 1242. 17 Two facilities most likely
related to astronomical and astrological activities are depicted as located near the
Palace in a 17th century copy of the atlas ảồng Đức B̫n Đồ 洪德版圖 (Maps
Дof VietnКm] printed Дin the erК] “Overwhelming virtue”) of 1490 (Fig. 1), 18

the Noon Tower. [It] was the place to operate the clepsydra”; see also a translation in
PolyКkov Д1980: 147]. This event is descriЛed in the Đại Việt sử ký toрn thư大越史記
全書年in slightly different terms: “前⸘奉⮸殿。ₙ建正陽樓。ⅴ為主掌籌刻之處”
ДTT 1984: 221]. If the word 籌 was not a copyist’s mistake, it may have referred to the
counting rods used for astronomical computations. These counting rods were used by
VietnКmese Кstronomers until the 17th century or even lКter; see Volkov 2009.
16. SL 1936: 61; PolyКkov 1980: 206.
17. The chronicles do not mention the КnnulКr eclipse of August 4th 1217, visiЛle in Northern
VietnКm, or the eclipse on MКy 23rd 1221, visiЛle in ChinК Кnd in Northern VietnКm.
The [Đại] Việt sử lược does not contКin Кny relevКnt informКtion dКted Кfter 1225, Кnd
the Đại Việt sử ký toрn thư 大越史記全書年does not mention the eclipses that occurred
on July 3rd 1228 Кnd DecemЛer 19th 1237. The eclipse of 1229 mentioned in the Đại
Việt sử ký toрn thư (Ho 1964: 139, no. 34) is ictitious; the eКrliest КctuКl eclipse Кmong
those listed in the lКtter chronicle Кs hКving occurred in the 13th century is thКt of
SeptemЛer 26th 1242 (iЛid., no. 35). InformКtion КЛout these Кnd other solКr eclipses is
taken from the NASA webpage “Eclipse Predictions by Fred Espenak, NASA’s GSFC”
at http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEatlas/SEatlas.html.
18. The replacement of the taboo characters 邦年and 新 (used in the personal names of the
Vietnamese emperors Anh Tông 英宗, personal name Lê Duy Bang年黎維邦, r. 1557-
1572, Кnd Kính Tông 敬宗, personal name Lê Duy Tân 黎維新, r. 1600-1618) in the
extant atlas suggests that it is not an exact copy of the original edition but its later
modiied version, see Liu et al. 2002: 305. John. K. Аhitmore (1995: 486) provides
additional details suggesting that the extant atlas is a 17th century re-edition of the 15th
century prototype; see Кlso PКpin 2001: 123-124.

Ti Thiên Giám 司⮸監 (A), the “Ofice of PКying TriЛute to HeКven” Phụng Thiшn
Phủ 奉⮸府 (B), and the “Directorate of Education” Quốc tử giám 國子監 (C).
Even though the nКme of the “Ofice of PКying TriЛute to HeКven” mentions
Heaven and is conspicuously similar to that of the “Pavilion of Paying Tribute to
Heaven” (Phụng Thiшn Điện 奉⮸殿) of the (LКter) Lý DynКsty, I Кm currently
not КwКre of Кny evidence suggesting thКt the functions of the Ofice involved
time-keeping or other activities related to astronomical observations. The
“Directorate of Heavenly Affairs” is depicted on the map as located to the South
of the ImperiКl PКlКce Лetween the “Ofice of PКying TriЛute to HeКven” Кnd
the “Directorate of Education” (Quốc tử giám年國子監, Chinese Guo zi jian), the
higher education authority. The name of the former institution, Ti Thiên Giám
司⮸監, is identical with that of its Chinese counterpart; in China it was given
to the AstronomicКl/AstrologicКl BureКu for the irst time in the 10th century
ofice (literКlly “Supervising Authority in chКrge of ДmКtters relКted to] HeКven”) wКs
conducting exclusively astronomical activities, while the institution was actually in
charge of observation of all kinds of celestial phenomena (including meteorological
ones) and of their interpretation, astronomical as well as astrological.

Кnd used Кlmost systemКticКlly during the ВuКn (stКrting from the 1260s), the
Ming, Кnd (unoficiКlly) the Qing dynКsties. 20 The exact time of establishment
of the Vietnamese “Directorate of Heavenly Affairs” is not known.
It remains unknown whether the original “Directorate of Heavenly Affairs”
of the early 11th century was built in the location shown on the map. It was most
likely shut down during the Chinese occupКtion of 1407-1427, ЛecКuse it would
otherwise hКve chКllenged the exclusive right of the Chinese oficiКl Кstrologers
to conduct and interpret astronomical observations. One can conjecture that the
institution was re-opened soon after the retreat of Chinese army, and remained
functional throughout the 17th century, when the copy shown in Fig. 1 was
produced.
Equally unknown is how exactly the personnel of the astronomical/
astrological service was trained, yet it would be reasonable to conjecture that
the Vietnamese authorities established a special educational program to train
future astronomers and astrologers, as was the case in China. The Directorate
would thus have been responsible for conducting observations, interpreting
astronomical and meteorological data, performing computations of the calendar,
predicting eclipses, and training future employees. Most likely this institution
had a specialized library holding books on astronomy and astrology that were
not supposed to circulКte outside of the ofice. An indirect piece of evidence
supporting this assumption is found in the Chinese collection of statutes Song hui
yao 宋會要: in К record dКted 1107 it is mentioned thКt the VietnКmese envoys
to China made attempts to obtain books on various disciplines, and that they
were given permission to purchase all texts except those deemed “forbidden,”
that is, related to divination, yin-yang, the calendar, and numerology; this very
mention seems to suggest that the envoys were especially interested in books
on these topics. 21 Attempts to obtain texts related to calendars (and, most likely,
Кstrology) continued through the eКrly 14th century. 22
The curriculum of the Chinese School of Computations (Suan xue 算學)
of the eКrly 12th century included К numЛer of suЛjects directly relКted to the
calendar and to astrology, in particular to the so-called “three schemes” or “three
cosmic boards” san shi ₘ式, that is the three major methods of divination (see
Лelow), Кs well Кs other unidentiied КstrologicКl texts. 23 If astronomical and
astrological texts were included in the curriculum of the discipline referred
to as “counting” 算年(Vietnamese toán, Chinese suan) in Vietnam, then the

state examinations on “counting” mentioned in historical documents may
have included parts related to calendrical and astrological computation, as
was the case in China during the Song dynasty. 24 There exist records of state
exКminКtions on “counting” held in VietnКm in 1077, 25 1261, 26 1363, 27 1404, 28
1477, 29 1507, 30 Кnd 1762. 31
Descriptions of the activities of the professional astronomers and astrologers
employed by the Vietnamese authorities can be found in the memoirs of the
ItКliКn Jesuits Christophoro Borri (1583-1632) Кnd GiovКnni Filippo de
24. The anonymous reviewers of this paper rightly pointed out that the description of the
exКminКtions on “counting” of 1762 (CM 1996: 3720-3721) mentions proЛlems on lКtrate and weighted distribution (Viet. bình phân ㄂分 and sai phân 差分 respectively) as
the topic of the examinations on “counting” (actually, the chronicle mentioned this topic
Кs one Кmong others, yet those “others” were not speciied); on distriЛution proЛlems in
VietnКmese mКthemКtics see Volkov 2012, Кnd on КdministrКtive Кctivities involving К
certain mathematical knowledge, such as land surveying and accounting, see Poisson
2004. This record thus suggests thКt Лy the 18th century mКthemКticКl Кnd КstrologicКl
subjects were most probably taught separately; this conjecture may be supported by
a record dated to the 7th year of the (Vietnamese) C̫nh ảưng年景咗年erК (1740-1786),
thКt is, 1746 (mentioned in CM 1969 Кs corresponding to the 11th yeКr of the (Chinese)
Qianlong年乾隆 erК, 1735-1796, thКt is, 1745) concerning exКminКtions conducted
exclusively on КstrologicКl suЛjects (CM 1969: 3606). However, the sepКrКtion of the
two curricula apparent in these documents of the mid-18th century does not warrant
the conclusion that instruction in mathematics and astrology was always conducted
separately; in other words, it cannot be ruled out that at an early stage Vietnamese
mathematical instruction imitated the Song dynasty model in which a number of subjects,
purely mathematical from a modern viewpoint, were taught together with astronomical
Кnd КstrologicКl ones, see Lee 1985: 96 Кnd FriedsКm 2003: 52.

MКrini (1608-1682), who visited CochinchinК (CentrКl VietnКm) Кnd Tonkin
(Northern Vietnam), respectively. Borri’s description shows that not only the
King of Cochinchina, but also the princes, had their own astrologers whose
work included calculation of solar eclipses; de Marini describes a special ritual
that was supposed to be conducted by the ruler on the day of the solar eclipse. 32
These descriptions suggest that by the 17th century the Vietnamese astronomers
enjoyed К rКther high oficiКl stКtus, thКt they used Chinese methods of prediction
of eclipses, and that they sometimes could not correctly adjust these methods
to the locations (i.e. northern and central Vietnam) where the eclipses were
supposed to be observed.
An oficiКl institution responsiЛle for КstronomicКl КffКirs Кnd the cКlendКr
continued to exist in VietnКm until the 20th century. A description (dКting to
1930) of the КstronomicКl/КstrologicКl ofice Khâm Thiên Giám 欽⮸監, the
successor of the Ti Thiên Giám 司⮸監,
 33 describes the structure and personnel
of the КstronomicКl/КstrologicКl ofice locКted in Hue, the cКpitКl of the Nguyễn
dynКsty (1802-1945), Кnd Лriely relКtes its history, Лeginning from the erК of
the Emperor Minh MКng (r. 1820-1841). 34
Astronomical observations conducted in Vietnam
Ho Peng Вoke in his pКper (1964) provided К list of the solКr eclipses
mentioned in the Đại Việt sử ký toрn thư 大越史記全書年(Complete Annals of
the GreКt ДStКte of] Việt) Кs oЛserved in VietnКm. Ho’s КnКlysis demonstrКted
that “much of the earlier materials of the Đại Việt sử ký toрn thư were taken from
Chinese sources, including their misprints” (p. 128). The records of eclipses
in the Annals Кre not distriЛuted homogenously: there Кre 21 eclipses for the
period from 205 BC to 122 BC, one eclipse for eКch of the yeКrs AD 41, 479, Кnd
547, 35 Кnd then К series of 45 eclipses for the period from AD 993 to 1671. The
records concerning the eclipses from 205 BC to AD 547 were, Кs Ho suggests,
copied from Chinese sources. One is thus tempted to suggest that the beginning
of a (relatively) systematic observation of solar eclipses in Vietnam may have

of paying respect to Heaven”) as “Directorate of Astronomy,” even though his own
description makes it clear that the occupations of its staff included meteorological
observations and divination.

coincided with the establishment of an astronomical/astrological service in the
capital. 36 The above-mentioned [Đại] Việt sử lược [大]越史略年(An Abridgement
of the History of the [Great state of] Viet) also contains records of solar eclipses,
yet these records are not identical with those listed in the Đại Việt sử ký toрn thư.
More speciicКlly, ДĐại] Việt sử lược contКins records of only ive solКr eclipses,
of which the eКrliest is dКted FeЛruКry 15th 1040; 37 this eclipse, actually visible
in Vietnam, is also listed in the Đại Việt sử ký toрn thư.
 38 Interestingly enough,
the four remaining eclipses recorded in the [Đại] Việt sử lược are not found in
the Đại Việt sử ký toрn thư. Only one of them, the eclipse of MКrch 11th 1206,
corresponds to an eclipse that actually happened (even though most likely it
was not visible in Vietnam); 39 two out of the remaining three eclipses occurred
in years slightly different from those indicated in the [Đại] Việt sử lược,
 40 while
one record does not correspond to any actual eclipse that might have happened
either earlier or later, unless both the month and the year of the eclipse were
changed considerably by the compilers of the history or by later copyists. 41
36. It is possible that the distribution of the eclipses mentioned in the Đại Việt sử ký toрn
thư was intentionally brought into correspondance with the political history of Vietnam,
ЛecКuse Кll the recorded eclipses, except those of 479 Кnd 1422, Лelonged to periods
of the formКl independence of VietnКm from ChinК: the period from 205 to 122 BC
corresponds to the VietnКmese Triệu 趙年dynКsty (207-111 BC), the eclipse of AD 41
hКppened during the reЛellion of the Trưng 徵年sisters (AD 40-43), Кnd the eclipse of
547 fКlls within the period of rule of the VietnКmese EКrly Lý DynКsty (544-602). The
eclipse of April 8th 479 wКs Кn КnnulКr one, visiЛle in IndiК Кnd ChinК Кnd proЛКЛly
hКrdly noticeКЛle in VietnКm; conversely, the totКl eclipse of SeptemЛer 20th 461,
perfectly visiЛle in Northern VietnКm, wКs not listed. The eclipse of 23rd JКnuКry 1422
was not visible in Vietnam either.

Astrological treatises: introductory remarks
Astrological treatises preserved in collections of Vietnamese books
written in Hán and Nôm are listed in the bibliography found at the end of this
paper; the reader can see that in the majority of cases one deals with undated
manuscript copies of uncertain origin. The printed books usually bear the dates
of puЛlicКtion, Кnd these dКtes Кre compКrКtively recent, from the lКte 19th to
the eКrly 20th century. These lКte dКtes of print do not necessКrily correspond
to the actual time of compilation; however, without substantial evidence to the
contrary, it seems reasonable to suggest that most of the extant Vietnamese
materials on astrology were physically produced relatively late, even though,
hypothetically, they might have been based on earlier sources. This statement
does not deny that historically much earlier astrological literature may well
hКve existed in VietnКm. There Кre two reКsons to clКim so: irstly, the oficiКl
institutions dealing with astronomical and astrological matters established in
independent Vietnam in the early 11th century must have possessed a number
of texts pertКining to their Кctivities; secondly, there Кre mentions of inluentiКl
astrological works compiled by Vietnamese scholars which are no longer extant.
For exКmple, it is known thКt Trần Nguyên Đán 陳元㡵年(1325-1390), К highlevel advisor to the Vietnamese Emperor, compiled the treatise Bách thế thông
kỷ thư 百世通紀書年(Scripture of the comprehensive chronicles of a hundred
generations); this treatise was lost, but, according to a description found in a
slightly later text, it contained a reconstruction of Chinese (?) chronology and
a (retrospective?) calculation of eclipses. 42
According to the conventional accounts, a large number of the books in
VietnКmese governmentКl liЛrКries were lost to ire or tКken Лy the Chinese
invКders in the lКte 14th – eКrly 15th centuries. If, Кccording to legends, the ire
thКt occurred during the sКck of the cКpitКl Лy the ChКms in 1371 indiscriminКtely
destroyed К numЛer of unspeciied liЛrКries, the Chinese invКders who Кllegedly
seized a large number of books and transported them to China most probably
42. See the Records of Dreams of the Old Man from the South (Vietnamese Nam ông mông
lục 南翁夢錄, Chinese Nan weng meng lu) Лy Hồ Nguyên Trừng 胡元澄 (also known
Кs Lê Trừng 黎澄, 1374?-1446?), the relevКnt excerpt reКds: ␅人通曉曆法，䞭著

especiКlly tКrgeted texts seen Кs symЛolicКlly Кfirming the independence of the
VietnКmese stКte, thКt is, irst of Кll, locКl chronicles, cКlendКrs, КstronomicКl
and astrological texts. 43
The search for Vietnamese materials related to astrology is also complicated
by the composite structure of the extant documents; a number of the manuscript
books preserved in libraries are collections of texts of different natures that may
contain sections copied from astrological books. Several astrological treatises
cКtКlogued in Trần Кnd Gros 1992 Кnd Liu et al. 2002 contКin Кppendices
that sometimes consist of minor astrological texts with different titles often
unrelated to each other and to the principal treatises (for examples, see below).
Moreover, even when the title of a treatise coincides with that of a well-known
Chinese astrological text, it may well be an abridgement or a variation on the
theme of the Chinese prototype, or an edition with commentaries in Classical
Chinese or in Nôm added by Vietnamese authors. This is why the list of primary
astrological sources found in the bibliography below cannot be considered
complete; nevertheless, it allows us to see, at least to a certain extent, which types
of astrological texts were most frequently reproduced and commented upon.
In the next section I will Лriely discuss the extКnt sources. The discussion
is suЛdivided into two pКrts: irstly, I will introduce the three mКjor systems of
Chinese Кstrology Кnd Лriely present the extКnt VietnКmese treКtises КppКrently
inluenced Лy them; secondly, I will, equКlly Лriely, discuss the structure of К
Vietnamese treatise based on a Chinese prototype.
Three traditions of Chinese medieval astrology and their reception
in Vietnam
The three most inluentiКl trКditions of Chinese Кstrology, represented
in the curriculum of the Song dynasty School of Computation as the “three
[astrological] schemes” or the “three cosmic boards” (san shi年ₘ式), were the
divinatory systems Tai yi年⮹乙, Qimen dunjia 奇門遁甲, and Liu ren⏼⭻.

43. TrКn 1938: 43, n. 3; CКdière Кnd Pelliot 1904: 619, n. 3.
44. Ho Peng Вoke (2003) suggests the following trКnslКtion of the nКmes of these three
astrological techniques: (1) “Method of the Taiyi Deity” (p. 36), (2) “ДAligning] the
Distinguished-Ones and the [auspicious] Gates [together with] concealing the [Wood] jia
stem” (p. 84) while criticizing such more strКightforwКrd renderings Кs “StrКnge GКtes
EscКping Techniques” (p. 83), Кnd (3) “The method of employing the six sexКgenКry
cyclical numbers with the Yang Water stem” (p. 5) preferring it to the more literal “The
art of the six Yang Waters” (p. 113). For the sКke of Лrevity I will use the Chinese
transliteration of these names below.
Alexei Volkov
126
(1) The Tai yi system. In China, this system was adopted by the Astrological
BureКu during the TКng dynКsty (618-907) Кnd wКs used through the Song
dynКsty (960-1279). 45 Yan Dunjie 嚴敦㧿年(1917-1988) discovered thКt the
divination techniques of this tradition already existed in the early 6th century
AD. 46 The foundational text of this tradition was the Taiyi jinjing shijing ⮹乙金
鏡式經 (Golden Mirror Manual for the Tai yi Cosmic Board) by Wang Ximing
王希明 (Tang dynasty), preserved (probably with later additions) in the 18th
century Chinese collection Si ku quan shu 四庫全書. The divinatory procedure
involved manipulation with a divinatory board (or, possibly, a diagram) which
featured a central circle and four concentric circular layers subdivided into 16
sectors eКch. The irst lКyer wКs illed with numЛers from 1 to 4 Кnd from 6 to
9, forming, together with the numЛer 5 in the centrКl circle, К mКgic squКre; the
irst circulКr lКyer Кlso contКined 8 trigrКms Кnd some cyclicКl signs. The next
layer contained names of “divine agents,” and the third layer, names of Chinese
provinces. 47 The lКst lКyer wКs empty Кnd wКs supposed to Лe illed during the
process of divination. As Ho suggests, the applications of this method were
mainly related to military affairs, yet there were also cases when the divination
was concerned with natural phenomena, such as earthquakes, thunderstorms,
and even eclipses. 48
Among the extant Vietnamese texts there are two treatises directly related to
this tradition: the Thái ̬t Dị Gi̫n Lục ⮹乙易簡錄年(Brief record [concerning
divination according to the method] Tai Yi and [to the Book of] Changes) ДA38]
and the Thái ̬t Thống Tông B̫o Giám ⮹乙統宗寶鑑 (Precious mirror of
Uniied Origins of the Дmethods of] Tai Yi) ДA39]. The former treКtise is credited
to the authorship of the famous literatus Lê Quý Đôn 黎貴惇年(1726-1784).
According to the ЛiogrКphy of Lê Quý Đôn Кuthored Лy Nguyễn Hữu Tạo 阮
㦘造年(who oЛtКined the doctorКl degree Tiến Sĩ 進⭺, Chinese jinshi, in 1844),
Lê wrote three more astrological treatises, one of which, namely the Thái ̬t
Quái Vận ⮹乙卦運 (Circulation of Tai Yi [among] the trigrams), now lost, was
apparently related to the same system of divination. 49 As for the treatise Thái ̬t
Thống Tông B̫o Giám ⮹乙統宗寶鑑, it is possible that this book is a copy or
45. Ho 2003: 36.
46. Ho 2003: 36-40: 171, n.3-4; Ho suggests thКt К recently uneКrthed divinКtory instrument
of the HКn dynКsty mКy hКve represented К rudimentКry form of this technique (p. 41).
See Кlso KКlinowski 1991: 105, 542, n. 79, 568, n. 23.
47. This element of the divinКtory scheme must КppКrently hКve Лeen modiied when
transmitted to Vietnam.
48. Ho 2003: 66-68.
49. TrКn 1937: 33. Two other treКtises were relКted to the system of divinКtion Liu ren; I
will return to them below. Tran also mentions another literary work of Lê devoted to
Astrology and Hemerology in Traditional Vietnam
127
an abridgement of the Chinese treatise (reproduced in the Si ku quan shu 四庫
全書) of the sКme title Лy Кn oЛscure Кuthor of the ВuКn dynКsty (1279-1368),
known under the pseudonym “Old Man from the Xiao Mountains” (Xiao shan
lao ren年曉山老人). Several Chinese editions of this Chinese treatise exist, the
earliest is a Ming dynasty manuscript and there are several editions dating from
the Qing dynasty.
In China, the Tai yi system was preserved within the so-called tradition
of “Numerical divination of Purple Rose and Dipper” (Ziwei doushu 紫微[=
薇]斗數). 50 Ho Peng Yoke claimed that there were two branches of the latter
tradition: one of them was a direct continuation of the Tai yi system, while
the other, represented by a version of the treatise found in the Daoist Canon
(Daozang 道藏), resulted from a synthesis of several astrological systems of
Western origin. 51 There exist seven Vietnamese texts belonging to this tradition:
An tử vi quốc ngữ ca ⸘紫微國語歌年[A1], Tử Vi Đẩu Số 紫微斗數年ДA47], Tử
Vi Đẩu Số Gi̫i Âm 紫微斗數解音年ДA48], Tử Vi Gi̫i 紫微解 ДA49], Tử Vi ảр

Vi Thập Nhị Cung Đoán Pháp Quốc Âm Ca 紫微十ℛ宮斷法國音歌 ДA52].
Four out of these seven treКtises, nКmely, ДA1, A47, A48, A52] Кre written in
Nôm or contain commentaries in Nôm and were apparently intended for those
readers who were not comfortable with classical Chinese.

when Tran was writing his article, is now lost.

northern circumpolКr Кsterism, see, for exКmple, Ho 2003: 76.

There exist 10 mКnuscript copies of ДA47] (К horoscope from it is shown in
Fig. 2); this lКrge numЛer of copies suggests thКt the treКtise wКs rКther populКr
Кmong prКctitioners. MeКnwhile, two of the seven texts, ДA49] Кnd ДA50], Кre
hКndwritten copies of unidentiied Chinese printed originКls. UnfortunКtely,
none of these manuscript texts is dated. The titles of the treatises might seem
to suggest that they were entirely devoted to only one system of divination;
however, this is not necessarily the case: for example, the text [A1] contains
an independent treatise Mã tiền bốc pháp 馬前卜法 ДA24] Кs its lКst section.
(2) The Qimen dunjia system. Early mentions of the methods Qimen 奇門年
and Dunjia 遁甲年can be found in the treatise Baopuzi 抱樸子authored by the
famous Chinese scholar Ge Hong 葛洪年(283-343). A numЛer of Лooks КppКrently
related to the Dunjia tradition are mentioned in the bibliographic chapters of
Astrology and Hemerology in Traditional Vietnam
129
the standard Chinese histories Hou Han shu 後漢書, Sui shu 隋書, Jiu Tang
shu 舊唐書 and Xin Tang shu 新唐書, but none of these books is now extant.
A text titled Huangting Dunjia yuan shen jing 黃庭遁甲緣身經年is found in
juan 14 of the DКoist collection Yun ji qi qian 雲笈七籤年(Seven Tablets from
Cloudy Book Depository) edited in the early 11th century and preserved in the
Daozang; however, the system described there was not one of the “three cosmic
boards” used for instruction in the Song dynasty “School of Computations.” 52
It appears that originally Qimen and Dunjia referred to two different systems
that were combined by the 8th century at the latest.
This tradition was apparently not very popular in Vietnam; I was able to
locate only two manuscripts related to it, the Độn Giáp Kы Môn年遁甲奇門 ДA13]
and Tam Kы Bát Môn Độn Pháp ₘ奇⏺門遁法 ДA36]. Both Кre compiled in
classical Chinese by anonymous authors; the dates of their compilation are
unknown. The former manuscript contains an appendix titled Chiшm Tinh Bốc
Pháp 占星卜法 (Methods of divination on the basis of asterisms). However, it
appears that a number of extant treatises preserved elements of the Qimen dunjia
system combined with the third of the “cosmic boards” traditions, the Liu ren.
(3) The Liu ren system. The origin of the third Chinese “cosmic board”
system of divination, Liu ren ⏼⭻ (Vietnamese Lục Nhсm), goes back to the
period КntedКting the HКn dynКsty (206 BC-AD 220), even though the irst
complete description of the method dКtes to the TКng dynКsty (618-907). 53 A
detailed discussion of the method provided by the polymath Shen Gua 沈括年
(or Shen Kuo, 1031-1095) in his Mengxi bitan 夢䄹筆談年shows how much the
system of Liu ren was interrelated with the calendar. 54 In the process of divination
a duodenary circular table (cosmic board) was supposed to be used; it could be
substituted by the diviner’s palm, which made the system more “portable,” if
compared with the two other systems. 55
This tradition apparently enjoyed great popularity in Vietnam; I was able to
locate the following treatises: Đại Lục Nhсm Đại Toрn 大⏼⭻大全 [A11], Lục
Nhâm ⏼⭻ [A17], Lục Nhсm Đại Độn年⏼⭻大遁年ДA18, A19], Lục Nhсm Đại

explaining in Nôm the Lục Nhсm (that is, Liu ren ⏼⭻) system of divination;
these appendices are credited to the authorship of the famous literatus and
high level governmentКl oficer Phùng Khắc KhoКn 馮克寬 (1528-1613) who
wКs sent Кs КmЛКssКdor to ChinК in 1597 Кnd returned in 1599. 57 According to
some sources, Phùng Khắc KhoКn trКnslКted the Yijing into Vietnamese (that
is, Nôm); 58 this fКct mКy Лe used to conirm his expertise in mКntic literКture
as well as his interest in the translation of Chinese texts into Vietnamese, even
though one cannot entirely rule out the possibility that the authorship of Phùng,
the famous literatus and ambassador to China, was assigned to anonymous
astrological texts only later to increase their importance. A text titled Binh
gia вếu chỉ ␄家要旨 (Chinese: Bing jia yao zhi) (Essential indications for
militaries), devoted to applications of divination for military purposes and
supposedly Кuthored Лy Phùng, is Кppended to the treКtise ДA22], while К short
treatise titled Thiшn Vận Bí Thư ⮸運秘書年(Chinese Tian yun bi shu), Secret
scripture on heavenly cycles, featuring connections between meteorological
phenomena and calendars, and also credited to Phùng’s authorship, is appended

57. His trКvel to ChinК is mentioned in CM 1969: 2832; it is dКted to the fourth month of the

Processing Chinese texts: the example of the Ngọc Hạp Kí 玉匣記
In this section I would like to demonstrate the complexity of the process
of compilation of Vietnamese astrological texts on the basis of their Chinese
prototypes. Let us consider the case of a group of treatises related to the tradition
of the Chinese astrological compendium Yu xia ji 玉匣記 (Records from the Jade
Chest). The titles of a number of Vietnamese texts contain the term Ngọc ảạp
玉匣 (Jade Chest), namely, the Ngọc ảạp 玉匣 ДA25], Ngọc ảạp To̫n Yếu 玉
匣纂要 ДA26], Ngọc ảạp to̫n вếu thông dụng 玉匣攢要通用 ДA27], Tăng Bổ
Tuвển Trạch Thông Thư Qu̫ng Ngọc ảạp Kí 增補選擇通書ㅲ玉匣記 ДA37],
and Thông Thư Qu̫ng Ngọc ảạp Kí年通書ㅲ玉匣記 ДA44]. This trКdition wКs
apparently quite popular: the Library of the Institute of Hán-Nôm Studies holds
10 printed copies of ДA25], one of them dКted to 1876 Кnd one to 1923; the
treКtises ДA27], ДA37] Кnd ДA44] were Кlso printed. The Кuthors of the cКtКlogs
Trần Кnd Gros 1993 Кnd Liu 2002 Кgree thКt these texts reproduce К Chinese
original and credit the authorship of them to the Daoist immortal “Perfected Lord
Xu” (許真君), that is, Xu Xun 許遜 (239-292/374?). 60 The text of the Daozang
entitled Xu zhen jun yu xia ji 許真君玉匣記 (Records from the Jade Chest of
the Perfected Lord Бu) with К prefКce of 1433 ДВБJ], is, indeed, explicitly
credited to his authorship. 61 Was Xu Xun, famous mainly as a dragon-slayer
and a pious son, also an expert in astrology? 62 The question is probably not as
relevant to the topic of this section as the following one: Was this text from the
Daozang indeed reproduced in the above-mentioned Vietnamese treatises? A
cursory КnКlysis shows thКt the Кnswer is in the КfirmКtive, Лut the situКtion is
far from being simple. The original text found in the Daozang under the title
玉匣記年(Records from the Jade Chest) technically contains three parts: (A) the
59. See also the voluminous mansucript Binh Pháp Tập Lược ␄法輯略 (Chinese Bing fa
ji lüe) Кllegedly compiled Лy Liu Bowen (Liu Ji) Кnd edited Лy Nguyễn Đức Uông 阮
德汪 (dКtes unknown), TG 246 (К microilm copy of it is КvКilКЛle in the liЛrКry of the
EFEO in Paris); this treatise is devoted to military applications of astrology.
60. For biographic data on Xu Xun as found in the Daozang Кnd his cult, see Boltz 1987:
70-78.
61. For К short description see Ren 1991: 1170, no. 1467.
62. One text compiled no eКrlier thКn 1295 mentions Бu Бun Кs “Бu TКishi zhenjun”年許
⮹史真君, that is, Xu Xun is explicitly mentioned here as Great Astrologer taishi年⮹史年
(HeКd of the AstrologicКl BureКu, see Hucker 1985: 481, no. 6212); J. Boltz suggested
“Perfected Lord Бu, the GrКnd ScriЛe” (1987: 75)

text titled Zhu shen sheng dan ling jie ri qi 諸神聖誕ⅳ節㡴期 dating to the
mid-15th century; (B) the above-mentioned Xu zhen jun yu xia ji 許真君玉匣
記 [YXJ]; and (C) the Fa shi xuan ze ji年法師選擇記 (Records on the choices
[of auspicious days] by Masters of Dharma) [XZJ]. The relatively short initial
section of pКrt (C), hereКfter C1 ДБZJ: 325-326], dКtes to AD 627 Кnd is followed
Лy К very long “Postscript” (C2) ДБZJ: 327-346] dКting to 1488 Кnd consisting
of a large number of relatively short astrological texts. If we now look at the
Vietnamese treatise Ngọc ảạp to̫n вếu thông dụng 玉匣攢要通用 ДA27], we
can see that part (A) is entirely omitted, a large portion of (B) is reproduced
in the opening section of the VietnКmese treКtise (pp. 2Л-6Л), Кnd pКrt (C1) is
reproduced immediКtely Кfter it (pp. 6Л-9Л); then follows К long section entitled
(in Chinese) “Zhan san shi er gua ding ji xiong” 占ₘ十ℛ掛定⚘凶年(Divination
Дusing] 32 hexКgrКms to determine good Кnd ЛКd luck, pp. 9Л-19Л) not found
in the Daozang edition. Only after that is the section entitled (in Chinese) “Jin
fu jing”年金符經年(TreКtise on the Golden TКlismКn, pp. 19Л-25К) reproduced
from the Daozang text ДБZJ: 331-334]. It is interesting thКt in the Daozang
the suЛtitle of this section is missing (p. 331), Кnd the fКct thКt the compilers
of the VietnКmese edition correctly identiied the locКtion of the title in their
edition of the text strongly suggests that they had at their disposal a version
of the treatise that was not based on the Daozang edition. How and when this
alternative version of the treatise reached the Vietnamese diviners will probably
remain unknown.
Conclusions
To study the history of the Vietnamese astrological tradition, several
approaches appear equally plausible. An investigation of the extant written
sources provided in the present paper is only one of them; another plausible
methodology would be a study of the written reports of the Western missionaries
active in Vietnam since the early 17th century, as well as of those by Western
and Chinese travelers and merchants. For a study of the present-day situation,
the results of recent КnthropologicКl ield studies could Лe used. EКch КpproКch
has its weak points. Numerous ancient documents are lost, and it is unknown to
what extent the extant Hán-Nôm treatises represent the corpus of astrological
works thКt circulКted Кmong VietnКmese Кstrologers from the 10th to the eКrly
20th century; it is equКlly unknown how much the КctuКl divinКtory prКctices
of those astrologers corresponded to written texts. If one studies the reports of
missionaries, merchants and travelers, the rare mentions of indigenous practices
of divination make it clear that their study was not central to the scholarly agenda
of the missionaries and explorers, and, moreover, the rationale of divinatory
Astrology and Hemerology in Traditional Vietnam
133
practices as well as the relevant documents were never disclosed to them by
the Vietnamese diviners. As for modern anthropologists, even those of them
who have attempted to take a closer look at the actual practices of diviners
nowadays were, in a large number of cases, not familiar with the historical
antecedents of the phenomena they observed, in particular with the divinatory
texts in Hán-Nôm.
In this pКper I Лriely descriЛed the institutionКl setting of the irst centuries of
the independent state-sponsored Vietnamese astrological tradition, and provided
the results of a cursory inspection of a small part of the extant astrological
materials. All the discussed materials turned out to be either copies of Chinese
texts (sometimes altered or abridged) or works based upon Chinese prototypes.
The history of their transmission to Vietnam is obscure; the majority of the extant
Vietnamese texts are not dated, and those dated were produced (usually, printed)
relatively late. Very often the authorship of the texts is unknown; in some cases,
the dates of life of the putative authors suggest that the transmission may have
taken place rather early, as in the case of the treatises credited to the authorship
of Phùng Khắc KhoКn 馮克寬, yet there is always a possibility that the name of
the presumed author, usually a famous scholar or a high-level functionary, was
associated with an anonymous text only after the scholar’s lifetime. However, as
the history of astrological institutions demonstrates, astrology certainly started
being practiced for the purposes of the Vietnamese state as early as the 11th
century; unfortunately, it remains unknown how and when the earlier Chinese
КstrologicКl texts found their wКy to the ЛreКkКwКy province Кfter the 10th
century, and what they were exactly. In the modern libraries holding collections
of Hán-Nôm books all the astrological texts are put together, which might appear
to suggest that astrology was a discipline practiced by just one group of experts;
however, one can argue that the transmission of astrological texts and expertise
went from China to Vietnam through a number of channels, and, on both sides,
the social groups involved in this process ranged from the imperial astrologers
to countryside fortune-tellers.
